Build Luxcore
----------
### Build on Ubuntu

    This is a quick start script for compiling Lux on  Ubuntu


    sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils git cmake libboost-all-dev
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev

    # If you want to build the Qt GUI:
    sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

    git clone https://github.com/Lux-core/lux --recursive
    cd Lux

    # Note autogen will prompt to install some more dependencies if needed
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure 
    make -j2

### Build on OSX

The commands in this guide should be executed in a Terminal application.
The built-in one is located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

#### Preparation

Install the OS X command line tools:

`xcode-select --install`

When the popup appears, click `Install`.

Then install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

#### Dependencies

    brew install cmake automake berkeley-db4 libtool boost --c++11 --without-single --without-static miniupnpc openssl pkg-config protobuf qt5 libevent imagemagick --with-librsvg

NOTE: Building with Qt4 is still supported, however, could result in a broken UI. Building with Qt5 is recommended.

#### Build Lux Core

1. Clone the Lux source code and cd into `Lux`

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Lux-core/lux.git
        cd Lux

2.  Build Luxcore:

    Configure and build the headless Lux binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).

    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.

        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make

3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests:

        make check

### Run

Then you can either run the command-line daemon using `src/Luxd` and `src/Lux-cli`, or you can run the Qt GUI using `src/qt/Lux-qt`

For in-depth description of Sparknet and how to use Lux for interacting with contracts, please see [sparknet-guide](doc/sparknet-guide.md).

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/Lux-core/lux/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Lux.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).


Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
